# `Reflection`

I am very proud that I was able to get all of the elements of the project working successfully. Going into the project, I was very worried that I was going in over my head. 
I knew none of the theory behind the Fourier transforms, and I was going to try to code it? There were definitely a few moments where I was regretting my choice of project, and even debating switching to something simpler.
I think the greatest takeaway from this project has been realizing that I am able to tackle difficult problems on my own. 
It might sound strange, but I can't count the number of times I have been interested in something, only to tell myself that "Oh that's probably too complicated for me to learn". 
Completing this project has proven to me that if you can break a difficult problem into small steps, then, while it might not be easy or fast, the problem can be solved in the end.
I am very proud that I was able to get all of my feature functions working and meet the "Advanced" criteria for both the feature functions and graphing. 
It may sound clique, but the thing that I will primarily remember a year from now is that I was successful in this project. 
I was able to not only learn a very difficult concept, but also implement it in code.
What I would have liked to do better is to have started the whole project earlier, giving myself more time to polish the final product. 
I personally feel that my project is impressive enough for me to put it into a portfolio of the interesting things that I have accomplished, so I will likely polish it anyways so that I able to do that.
